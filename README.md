# my-closet-gui
## Description
My Closet GUI is a JavaFX application designed to help visualize and manage your wardrobe. The project was initiated to explore and expand my software development skills by creating a practical solution for organizing clothing items. Using IntelliJ encouraged me to explore FXML and handle event handling and GUI design differently.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Leveraged skills from first-year Java coursework on ArrayLists, JavaFX, GUI design, event handling, and hierarchy.
- Self-explored FXML using IntelliJ to separate layout from logic, enhancing maintainability.
- Implemented event handlers for interactive navigation through clothing categories.
