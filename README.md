# my-closet-gui
## Description
My Closet GUI is a JavaFX application designed to help visualize and manage your wardrobe. The project was initiated to explore and expand my software development skills by creating a practical but simple solution for organizing clothing items and demonstrating my continuous curiosity and intermediary proficiency in Java. Using IntelliJ encouraged me to explore FXML and handle event handling and GUI design differently.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Solid understanding of OOP principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
- **Java Development**: Proficient in using core data structures such as arrays and ArrayLists, and comfortable with IntelliJ IDEA for project setup, debugging, and version control integration.
- **GUI Development**: Developed graphical user interfaces using JavaFX and FXML, with hands-on experience in event handling and layout management.
- **Leveraged Coursework**: Applied skills from first-year Java coursework, including OOP, JavaFX, GUI design, event handling, and hierarchy.
- **Continuous Curiosity**: Demonstrating the ability to build upon existing knowledge and tackle new challenges by continuously expanding skills and exploring new frameworks.
